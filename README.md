This is a client-side mod. The server doesn't need to have it installed. It works even when playing on vanilla servers.

## Configuration
This mod's config file is `betterpingdisplay.json`. It contains the following options:

| Option  | Default Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| autoColorPingText  | `true` | Whether to color a player's ping based on their latency. E.g, low latency = green, high latency = red |
| renderPingBars  | `false` | Whether to also draw the default Minecraft ping bars  |
| pingTextColor  | `#A0A0A0`  | The ping text color to use. Only works whens `autoColorPingText` is false |
| pingTextFormatString | `%dms` | The format string for ping text. Must include a `%d`, which will be replaced dynamically by the actual ping value.
