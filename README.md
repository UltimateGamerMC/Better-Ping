# Better Ping

**A continuation of the beloved Better Ping Display mod, updated and maintained for modern Minecraft.**

This client-side Fabric mod replaces Minecraft's ambiguous ping bars with actual numerical values, so you always know your exact connection quality at a glance.

## Features

- **See Your Real Ping** - Exact millisecond values instead of vague signal bars
- **Smart Color Coding** - Automatic color-coding based on latency (green = smooth, red = laggy)
- **Fully Customizable** - Adjust colors, text format, and display preferences to match your style
- **Works Everywhere** - Client-side only, so it works on any server including vanilla
- **Zero Bloat** - Simple, focused, and lightweight

## Why This Mod?

The original Better Ping Display was abandoned, leaving players without support for newer versions. Better Ping continues that legacy, keeping the mod alive and compatible with the latest Minecraft releases while staying true to its core purpose: giving you clear visibility of your connection.

## Easy Configuration

Customize everything through `betterpingdisplay.json`:
- Toggle automatic color-coding
- Show or hide original ping bars
- Set custom text colors
- Define your own format (e.g., `%dms`, `%d ping`)

## Supported Versions

1.21.9+1.21.10
